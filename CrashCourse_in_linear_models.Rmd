# Data analysis workflow

![The four steps in the workflow of a data analysis project](workflow.png){width=100%}


We're going to concentrate upon steps 3 and 4 of the workflow


# Steps 1 & 2: Tidy and import your data

The data are in a "comma-separated variable" format which is relatively easy to import using R's import functions (e.g. `read.table()` or `read.csv()`). 


```{r}
# Import climate data for six European cities for the period 1970-2022
climate = read.table('climate_change.csv', 
                     sep=',', 
                     header=TRUE)
```

Check that the imported data look OK.

Look at the first few lines of data
```{r}
# Look at first 6 lines of the imported data
head(climate)
```


Now look at a summary of the data
```{r}
# A summary of the data
summary(climate)
```


And the structure of the data frame, showing the data types
```{r}
# The structure of the data
str(climate)
```


## Wrangling the data

Location is a qualitative variable, so make sure this is set to be a `factor` 

```{r}
# Make sure location is a factor
climate$location = as.factor(climate$location)
```


Let's also add a variable that defines two periods: 1970-1979 and 2010-2019
```{r}
# Define two time periods
climate$period = NA
climate$period[climate$year>=1970 & climate$year<1980] = "1970s"
climate$period[climate$year>=2010 & climate$year<2020] = "2010s"
climate$period = as.factor(climate$period)
```


And we'll produce a subset that's just data for Dublin
```{r}
dublin_climate = subset(climate, location=="Dublin")
```


# Step 3: Explore your data

Plotting the data is a great way to explore the data

```{r message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

# Plot mean temperature for the six locations
ggplot(data=climate,
       aes(x=year,
           y=summer_dailyTmean,
           colour=location)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se=FALSE) + 
  theme_bw()
```


Looks like temperatures are increasing in some locations, but maybe not all. 

Another figure that compares the 1970s to the 2010s for Dublin

```{r}
# Plot mean temperature for the six locations
ggplot(data=dublin_climate,
       aes(x=period,
           y=summer_dailyTmean,
           fill=period)) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  theme_bw()
```




# Step 4: Analyse the data




```{r}
# Fit a linear regression model for mean daily temperature in Dublin
m_dublin = lm(summer_dailyTmean~1+year, 
              data=dublin_climate)
```


## Validate the model

### Residual versus fitted validation plot
Test whether: 
  + homogeneity of variance assumption is valid
  + the linear relationship is appropriate
  
using a residual versus fitted plot  
```{r}
# Ptot a residual versus fitted
plot(m_dublin, which=1)
```  



### Quantile-Quantile validation plot

Test whether: 
  + residuals follow a normal distribution
  
using a Q-Q plot  
```{r}
# Plot a residual versus fitted
plot(m_dublin, which=2)
```  



### Leverage plot

Test whether: 
  + any one data point is having too much influence on the model fit
  
using a Cook's distance leverage plot
```{r}
# Plot a leverage plot showing Cook's distance
plot(m_dublin, which=4)
```  
Cook's distance greater than 1 indicates observations that have a large effect on the fitted model. All looks good here.



## Hypothesis test



```{r}
# Fit the null model
m_null = lm(summer_dailyTmean~1, 
              data=dublin_climate)
```  



Perform hypothesis test by comparing null model to the full model

```{r}
anova(m_null, m_dublin)
```  

P-value (=0.017) is less than 5%, so we have evidence to **reject the null-hypothesis**. Mean daily temperature in Dublin has increased from 1970 until 2022.
