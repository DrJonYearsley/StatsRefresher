The data are from v26.0e of the gridded data at 0.25 degrees spatial resolution.Â  The data closest to six European cities has been extracted and the average taken for all days in winter (Dec, Jan, Feb) or in summer (June, July, Aug).

The variables are:

+ year : year of observations (1970 - 2022)
+ location : the European city (Dublin, Madrid, Oslo, Rome, Berlin, London)
+ longitude : the longitude of a location
+ latitude : the latitude of a location
+ summer_dailyTmean : the mean daily temperature, averaged across all days in June-Aug
+ winter_dailyTmean : the mean daily temperature, averaged across all days in Dec - Feb
+ summer_dailyRainfall : the total daily rainfall (mm), averaged across all days in June-Aug
+ winter_dailyRainfall : the total daily rainfall (mm), averaged across all days in Dec-Feb
